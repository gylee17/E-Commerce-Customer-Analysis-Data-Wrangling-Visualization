# E-Commerce Customer Analysis: Data Wrangling & Visualization

### Overview
This project focuses on cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing an e-commerce dataset to uncover trends and predict customer churn using logistic regression. It includes data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualizations, and predictive modeling.

### Features
- Data Wrangling: Handling missing values, outliers, and redundant columns.
- EDA & Visualization: Purchase trends, category transactions, heatmaps, and correlation graphs.
- Predictive Modeling: Logistic regression to identify key churn predictors.

### Dependencies
This project requires R packages for data manipulation, visualization, and modeling.

### Usage
- Preprocess Data: Clean missing values, transform dates, and standardize features.
- Visualize Trends: Generate bar charts, line graphs, heatmaps, and scatterplots.
- Train Model: Develop a logistic regression model to predict customer churn.

### Results
Key predictors of churn include Product Category, Payment Method, and Customer Age. Log-transformed purchase data improved model accuracy. The analysis provides valuable insights for customer retention strategies.
